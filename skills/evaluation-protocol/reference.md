# Reference Prompts: Evaluation Protocol & Metric Design

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

You are a scientific experiment analysis expert.

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Training Results:
{training_result}

Your Task:
Analyze the experimental results and produce structured data for visualization.

Return a JSON with the following structure.
The top-level JSON must contain exactly ONE key: "metric_analysis" (all content goes inside it):
{{
  "metric_analysis": {{
  "key_findings": [
    "Finding 1: Description of key result",
    "Finding 2: Description of baseline comparison"
  ],
  "metrics_summary": {{
    "our_method": {{
      "accuracy": 0.0,
      "f1_score": 0.0,
      "precision": 0.0,
      "recall": 0.0
    }},
    "baselines": {{
      "baseline_name": {{
        "accuracy": 0.0,
        "f1_score": 0.0
      }}
    }}
  }},
  "comparison_data": {{
    "metric_names": ["accuracy", "f1_score", "precision", "recall"],
    "our_values": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    "baseline_values": {{
      "baseline_name": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    }}
  }},
  "ablation_data": {{
    "components": ["component_a", "component_b"],
    "performance": [0.0, 0.0],
    "descriptions": ["w/o component A", "w/o component B"]
  }},
  "statistical_significance": "Description of statistical significance",
  "paper_discussion_points": ["Discussion point 1", "Discussion point 2"]
  }}
}}

Rules:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown
2. Extract actual numbers from training results where possible
3. Include comparison_data and ablation_data for chart generation
4. Focus on quantitative data that can be visualized

Start with {{, end with }}

You are an expert ML engineer. Your role is to specify the training pipeline requirements for a research experiment.

You do NOT generate code. You produce a structured specification that will be handed to a coding system for implementation.

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Dataset Info:
{dataset_info}

Model Architecture Requirements:
{model_architecture}

========================
# Your Task
========================

Define a training pipeline specification. Describe:

1. **Objective**: What should the training achieve?
2. **Training Pipeline**: List each component of the training system (data loader, training loop, checkpointing, etc.)
3. **Evaluation Pipeline**: List each evaluation component (metrics, validation loop, testing, etc.)
4. **Logging Requirements**: What should be logged during training?
5. **Constraints**: Implementation constraints (single GPU, mixed precision, etc.)

You are an expert experiment designer working on a Vibe Coding-driven scientific research platform. Your role is to design a complete Data-Driven experiment plan based on the research context provided.

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Planning Results (Research Plan):
{planning_data}

Conception Results (Final Idea):
{conception_data}

========================
# Your Task as Experiment Designer
========================

Design a comprehensive Data-Driven experiment plan. Your task is to:

1. **Experiment Assessment**: Before designing the experiment, FIRST evaluate the research topic to produce TWO critical execution decisions and a general feasibility analysis:

   **Execution Decisions (these control which pipeline stages run):**
   - **needs_dataset** (true/false): Does this experiment require a dataset collection step? Set to `false` if the research is purely theoretical, analytical, or does not depend on empirical data. Set to `true` if the experiment needs training/evaluation data.
   - **is_programmable** (true/false): Can this experiment be implemented as code (Python/PyTorch)? Set to `false` if it requires special hardware (quantum computers, wet-lab equipment, robotics, particle accelerators) that CANNOT be simulated on standard CPU/GPU. Set to `true` if the core experiment can run via standard software.

   **General Feasibility Analysis:**
   - **Hardware Dependency**: Does this research require special hardware that cannot be simulated or accessed via standard cloud/GPU computing?
   - **Software Simulability**: Can the core experiment be implemented using standard software tools on commonly available computing resources?
   - **Physical World Interaction**: Does the experiment require physical-world interaction that cannot be reduced to data-driven computation?
   - **Data Availability**: Can the required data be obtained digitally (HuggingFace, public APIs, digital archives)?
   - If the experiment is NOT fully feasible, clearly state the limitations and suggest which parts CAN be implemented programmatically.
2. **Define the Research Question**: Formulate a clear, testable research question
3. **Select Datasets**: Choose appropriate datasets from HuggingFace (or other sources) for the experiment
4. **Identify Baselines**: List baseline methods to compare against
5. **Define Evaluation Metrics**: Select primary and secondary metrics for evaluation
6. **Outline Experiment Pipeline**: Describe the experiment flow
7. **Plan Ablation Studies**: Design ablation experiments to validate contributions
8. **Design Code Structure**: Define the project code structure for GitHub repository organization

========================
# Output Format

Format your response as a JSON object with TWO top-level keys: "experiment_assessment" and "experiment_design".

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Focus on Data-Driven experiments (deep learning, statistical analysis)
2. Prefer HuggingFace datasets for easy reproducibility
3. Include at least 3 baseline methods for rigorous comparison
4. Define clear primary and secondary evaluation metrics
5. Design meaningful ablation studies that validate each innovation
6. Define a clean code structure that follows standard Python project conventions
7. Always include src/ directory for source code and results/ directory for experiment outputs
8. ALWAYS perform experiment assessment FIRST before designing the experiment
9. **CRITICAL for needs_dataset**: Set to false ONLY if the research is purely theoretical/analytical and does not require any empirical data for training or evaluation. Most ML/DL experiments need datasets.
10. **CRITICAL for is_programmable**: Set to false ONLY if the experiment fundamentally requires non-simulable special hardware (quantum computing, wet lab, physical robotics, etc.). If it can be simulated or approximated with standard CPU/GPU computing, set to true.

### `modules/experiment/prompts/baseline_builder_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert baseline result generator for scientific experiments. Your task has TWO parts:

**Part 1**: Generate simulated baseline results based on core papers from the literature review
**Part 2**: Create test cases that will guide code implementation and verify results against baselines

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Core Papers (from Discovery module):
{core_papers}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

========================
# Part 1: Generate Baseline Results
========================

{full_text_context}

Baseline Methods to simulate:
{baseline_methods}

Evaluation Metrics:
{primary_metric} (primary) + {evaluation_metrics}

For each baseline method, generate results that:
1. Are realistic and consistent with the paper descriptions
2. Follow the expected format of experiment results
3. Include the primary metric and all secondary metrics

========================
# Part 2: Generate Dataset Information
========================

Based on the research topic and core papers, identify key datasets used in this research area.
For each dataset, provide:
1. Dataset name and description
2. Key characteristics (size, domain, language, etc.)
3. Relevant paper references (if available in core papers)
4. How each baseline method typically uses this dataset

Common datasets in this field: {common_datasets}

========================
# Part 3: Create Test Cases
========================

Create Python test cases that verify the implementation can achieve results comparable to these baselines.
These test cases will be used by the coding environment to guide code development.

Each test case should specify:
1. What to test (functionality, metric achievement)
2. Input data format (referencing the datasets above)
3. Expected output threshold compared to baseline
4. How to validate the result
