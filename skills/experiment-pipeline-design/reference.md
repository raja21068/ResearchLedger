# Reference Prompts: Experiment Pipeline Design

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

You are a technical route planning expert. Please enhance the research plans with detailed technical implementation pipelines.

Current Research Plans (with method design):

For each plan, enhance the pipeline field with specific technical implementation steps.
