# Reference Prompts: Feasibility, Cost and Resource Plan

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

### `modules/resource/prompts/infra_selection.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert infrastructure selection advisor for research projects. Analyze the resource requirements and constraints to recommend the best infrastructure options.

## INPUT DATA

### Resource Specifications:
{resource_spec}

### Pricing Reference Data (Real Cloud Pricing):
{pricing_data}

### Constraints:
{constraints}

### Environment:
{environment}

## TASK REQUIREMENTS

You MUST analyze and recommend infrastructure options based on COMPLETE resource integrity constraints:
1. **Compute resource integrity** - Ensure ALL compute requirements are met (GPU, CPU, memory)
2. **Storage resource integrity** - Ensure ALL storage requirements are met (hot, cold, checkpoint storage)
3. **Network resource integrity** - Ensure ALL network requirements are met (egress, bandwidth)
4. **Budget constraints** - Stay within the specified budget
5. **Deadline constraints** - Meet the project timeline
6. **Performance requirements** - Ensure adequate compute power
7. **Environmental factors** - Consider location, data sensitivity, etc.

RESOURCE INTEGRITY VALIDATION:
- Any recommendation MUST validate that ALL resource requirements are fully satisfied
- Storage requirements must be explicitly checked and validated
- Network requirements must be explicitly checked and validated
- DO NOT ignore storage or network requirements in favor of compute-only optimization

## INPUT VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):

Before executing selection, you MUST validate input data:

1. **Pricing data validation** - Valid pricing data must exist for aws / aliyun
2. **Resource specification validation** - resource_spec must contain complete compute, storage, network specifications

**Validation failure handling rules:**
- If pricing data is missing or unavailable, fallback rules are prohibited
- Selection can only be executed after all validations pass

## FEASIBILITY GATING REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):

Before considering any options, you MUST perform feasibility checks:

1. **GPU resource check** - Option must provide sufficient GPU hours: GPU hours >= required_gpu_hours
2. **Storage resource check** - Option must provide sufficient storage space: storage >= required_storage
3. **Network resource check** - Option must provide sufficient network bandwidth: network >= required_network
4. **Time constraint check** - Option must complete within deadline: estimated_time <= deadline_days

**Feasibility determination rules:**
- If an option fails any condition above, mark as infeasible
- Remove infeasible options from candidate set
- Infeasible options are not allowed to participate in ranking or recommendation

**Special rules:**
- Free tier is considered infeasible by default unless explicitly meeting all resource requirements
- If all options are infeasible, must clearly state the reason

## CRITICAL JSON OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST return ONLY a JSON object, no additional text before or after the JSON
2. The JSON structure MUST exactly match the template below with ALL fields completed

```

### `modules/resource/prompts/instance_selection.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert in cloud infrastructure planning.

Your task is to select suitable cloud instances that satisfy the given resource requirements.

You must NOT assume a single instance. Instead, you should SEARCH and propose MULTIPLE candidate instances for each cloud provider.

====================
INPUT REQUIREMENTS
====================
- GPU type: {gpu_type}
- GPU count: {gpu_count}
- Required GPU performance: >= {min_performance_score}
- CPU cores: >= {cpu_cores}
- Memory: >= {memory_gb} GB

====================
AVAILABLE INSTANCE CATALOG (REAL PRICING DATA)
====================
{pricing_catalog}

====================
TASK
====================
1. For each cloud provider in the catalog above:
   - Propose 2-4 candidate instances from the REAL catalog
   - Include both "best match" and "near match" options
   - Use the EXACT instance_type names from the catalog

2. For each instance:
   - Evaluate feasibility:
     - "feasible" → fully satisfies requirements
     - "scalable" → can be satisfied by increasing GPU count or extending time
     - "infeasible" → cannot be satisfied even with scaling
   - If scalable/infeasible, specify missing resources

3. DO NOT filter out partial matches (they are useful for trade-off analysis)

====================
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON - NO MARKDOWN)
====================

**CRITICAL: You MUST output ONLY the raw JSON object. DO NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks.**

**DO NOT include ```json or ``` markers.**

**DO NOT add any text before or after the JSON.**

**The output must be a valid JSON object starting with {{ and ending with }}.**

          }}
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
}}

## PERFORMANCE MODEL RULES (MANDATORY):
**You are InstanceSelectorAgent. Your goal is not exact matching, but determining "whether requirements can be met through adjustments".**

========================

【RULES】

1. Do NOT use GPU model mismatch as the sole reason for rejection

2. Use performance model:

GPU performance benchmarks:
- H100 = 1.5
- A100 = 1.0
- V100 = 0.6
- A10G/A10 = 0.5
- T4 = 0.3
- P100 = 0.4
- RTX 4090 = 0.85
- RTX 4080 = 0.7
- RTX 3090 = 0.55
- Radeon Pro V520 = 0.25

required_compute = gpu_compute_units * gpu_hours

candidate_compute = gpu_performance * gpu_count * available_hours

------------------------

3. Feasibility classification:

- feasible:
  candidate_compute >= required_compute

- scalable:
  Can be satisfied by increasing GPU count or extending time

- infeasible:
  Cannot be satisfied (even with scaling)

------------------------

4. Output must include:

{{
  "feasibility": "...",
  "adaptation_plan": {{
    "gpu_count_adjustment": int,
    "time_adjustment_factor": float
  }}
}}
```

### `modules/resource/prompts/cost_estimation.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are a cloud cost estimation expert.

Your task is to estimate cost and select the best instance from candidates.

====================
INPUT
====================
Instance candidates: {instance_candidates}
Resource specification: {resource_spec}
Pricing reference data: {pricing_data}

====================
RULES
====================
1. ONLY consider instances with feasibility = "feasible" or "scalable"
2. Use the pricing reference data to calculate accurate costs
3. Estimate cost for EACH feasible instance considering:
   - Hourly price from pricing data
   - Required GPU hours from resource specification
   - Number of parallel instances needed
   - Storage costs (from pricing data storage section)
   - Network egress costs (from pricing data network section)

4. Select the most cost-effective one considering:
   - Total cost (primary factor)
   - Performance requirements
   - Resource specifications
   - Cost-effectiveness ratio

5. If no feasible instance exists: return "no feasible instance"

====================
SELECTION CRITERIA
====================
1. **Cost optimization** - Choose the instance with lowest total cost
2. **Performance matching** - Ensure the instance meets performance requirements
3. **Resource adequacy** - Verify CPU, memory, and GPU resources are sufficient
4. **Cost-effectiveness** - Balance cost vs performance

====================
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON)

You are an expert infrastructure recommendation system for research projects. Analyze the infrastructure options and provide detailed recommendations using multi-objective optimization with STRICT CONSTRAINT ENFORCEMENT.

Infrastructure selection: {infrastructure_selection}
Cost estimation: {cost_estimation}
Resource specification: {resource_spec}
Validation result: {validation}

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT RULES (HARD CONSTRAINTS):
1. **You MUST only recommend from feasible infrastructure options**
2. **You MUST NOT introduce new providers (e.g., free, local) if they are infeasible**
3. **If no feasible solution exists, return {{ 'status': 'no_feasible_solution' }}**
4. **Recommendations MUST be based on actual cost analysis from cost_estimation**
5. **Do not recommend options with cost=0 unless they are explicitly free resources**

MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST perform multi-objective optimization considering:
1. **Cost optimization** (40% weight): Minimize total cost while meeting requirements
2. **Time optimization** (30% weight): Consider project deadlines and time constraints
3. **Risk optimization** (30% weight): Evaluate reliability, availability, and technical risks

SCORING FORMULA:
Overall Score = (0.4 × normalized_cost_score) + (0.3 × normalized_time_score) + (0.3 × normalized_risk_score)

Provide a comprehensive recommendation that includes:
1. Overall best option with detailed multi-objective reasoning
2. Cost-performance analysis with specific optimization scores
3. Trade-offs between different options with weighted analysis
4. Specific recommendations based on multi-objective optimization
