# Research Process

> Ported from the ConvFusion research-skill library (category: `research-management`; origin: v2/native-process). Ask/answer using this method whenever it applies to the current research workspace.

## Purpose

Define the stages a research project passes through, and what counts as evidence that a stage has actually landed — so capability selection and progress reporting reflect a real research process rather than a fixed pipeline.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Deciding which capabilities a research project currently needs most.
- Reporting what a conversation changed about the research.
- Adapting the process to a discipline whose order genuinely differs from the default.

## Research Method

The stages below are a **default**, not a pipeline: they describe what a research project must eventually produce, not the order in which it must be produced. Real work moves back and forth between them, and nothing here blocks or schedules anything.
Each stage is judged by **artifacts on disk**, never by conversation content: a stage has landed only when the artifact it produces actually exists.
Edit the block below to define your own process. The first block containing `stage:` lines wins, and your customisation is composed **before** the default text — so your definition takes precedence without any extra setting.
Format: `stage: <id> | <display name> | <capability category> | <signal> | <what this stage produces>`. Signals come from a fixed vocabulary (see the header of this skill file in the repository); an empty or unknown signal means the stage is displayed but does not count towards the current-stage decision.

```text
stage: problem | 理解问题 | research-understanding | problem-defined | 可证伪的研究问题与范围（project.md）
stage: literature | 文献调研 | literature | literature-evidence | 实际检索到的文献证据（research/evidence/）
stage: innovation | 创新假设 | innovation | claims | 可检验的假设与主张（research/claims/）
stage: method | 方法设计 | methodology | method-plan | 可被第三方实现的方法设计
stage: experiment | 实验验证 | experiment | experiments | 实验产物（experiments/<name>/results/）
stage: analysis | 分析论证 | analysis | settled-evidence | 经确认的结果证据（Evidence 状态 supported/verified）
stage: decision | 研究决策 | research-decision | decisions | 已记录理由的研究决策（research/decisions/）
stage: writing | 论文写作 | academic-writing | manuscript | 论文正文（papers/<id>/paper.md）
```

A project that has landed every stage is not "finished" — research continues by evolving the same artifacts. The absence of a missing stage is not the absence of work.

## Reasoning Guidance

Focus on:

- Whether the artifact a stage produces actually exists on disk.
- Which stage is the first one without its artifact — that is the current gap.
- Whether a discipline’s process really differs, or the default order is merely unfamiliar.

Avoid:

- Treating the stage list as a schedule: nothing here may block, gate or order work.
- Inferring progress from conversation content — only artifacts count.
- Adding a stage whose signal is not in the vocabulary and expecting it to be judged.
- Reading "no missing stage" as "the research is done".

## Evidence Requirements

Every stage judgement must be checkable against the workspace: it names the artifact that would satisfy it. A stage is never marked landed on the strength of a claim in conversation.

## Expected Output

Produce:

- an ordered list of stages, each naming the capability category it draws on
- for each stage, the artifact that would prove it has landed
- the current stage (the first stage without its artifact), or an explicit statement that every stage has landed
- a note that the list describes assets, not a procedure to follow

## Workspace Conventions

If this method reads or writes structured workspace files (evidence/claims/decisions, plans, papers, outputs, LaTeX, literature search/download), follow the exact schemas in this plugin's `reference/` directory rather than improvising a format — see [research-assets.md](../../reference/research-assets.md), [plans.md](../../reference/plans.md), [papers.md](../../reference/papers.md), [outputs.md](../../reference/outputs.md), [latex.md](../../reference/latex.md), [literature-search.md](../../reference/literature-search.md), and [paper-fulltext-download.md](../../reference/paper-fulltext-download.md), whichever applies. The `research` skill's [SKILL.md](../research/SKILL.md) is the usual entry point that pulls the right context together first; if this skill was invoked on its own, check whether a `project.md` or `research-state.md` already exists in the workspace before assuming there is none.
