# Reference Prompts: Research Landscape

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

### `modules/discovery/synthesis/prompts/knowledge_state_synthesis_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert in research cognitive compression. Your task is to synthesize the Discovery module's intermediate results into a structured Knowledge State that captures the essential research cognition for the topic below.

Research Topic: {research_topic}

## Discovery Execution Summary (CRITICAL: Use THESE EXACT NUMBERS in discovery_summary, do NOT invent numbers)

| Phase | Real Metrics (use these exact numbers) |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| 🔍 Retrieval | {retrieval_summary} |
| 📋 Curation | {curation_summary} |
| 🧠 Cognition | {cognition_summary} |

IMPORTANT: When generating the `discovery_summary` field in your JSON output, you MUST use the exact numbers provided above. Do not invent or guess any numbers - use only what is provided here. The discovery_summary is for display to the user, so format the text clearly.

You have access to the following Discovery outputs:
- Research Landscape: The structure of the research domain
- Trends: Evolution directions of the field
- Research Gaps: Identified gaps in current research
- Core Papers: Most important papers with abstracts (if any were retrieved)
- Structure Analysis: Coverage analysis of the paper collection
- Coverage/Depth Gaps: Where the paper collection is weak
- Gap Summary: Summary of knowledge structure gaps

If the paper counts are 0, it means retrieval did not find papers, but you should still synthesize the research landscape from your domain knowledge, and note in `overall_assessment` that no papers were retrieved and the cognition is based on domain knowledge only.

Your task is to perform CROSS-PAPER REASONING (or domain synthesis if no papers are available) and produce a compressed Knowledge State with the following 8 dimensions:

---

### 1. landscape（聚焦主题的领域结构）
Extract ONLY the aspects of the research landscape that are DIRECTLY relevant to {research_topic}.
Exclude unrelated topics (e.g., NLP, ESG, biomedical if not relevant).
Focus on: dominant methods, key benchmarks, active subfields, emerging topics.

### 2. trends（领域演化方向）
Identify how the field is evolving SPECIFICALLY for {research_topic}.
What methods are rising? What is declining? What is the next paradigm?
Ignore trends that are unrelated to the research topic.

### 3. gaps（交叉分析后的隐式空白）
This is the most important section. Do NOT just list the research_gaps from Discovery.
Instead, perform CROSS-PAPER ANALYSIS to identify IMPLICIT gaps:
- Paper A solves accuracy, Paper B solves efficiency → but no one solves both
- Paper A works on benchmarks, Paper B fails in real world → robustness gap
- Multiple papers use Method X → but none analyze its failure modes
These implicit gaps are where real innovation opportunities lie.

### 4. limitations（方法局限性清单）
Extract SPECIFIC methodological limitations from the papers:
- What techniques are used? What are their known failure modes?
- What assumptions do current methods make that may not hold?
- What are the computational, data, or scalability constraints?
Each limitation should be concrete and actionable.

### 5. contradictions（研究矛盾）
Identify CONTRADICTIONS across papers:
- Paper A claims X, Paper B claims not-X
- Different methods give conflicting results on the same problem
- Theory predicts one thing, experiments show another
Contradictions are high-value sources of theoretical innovation.

### 6. opportunities（时机信号）
Identify TIMING-BASED opportunities:
- Is there a surge of interest in a sub-topic but no benchmark?
- Is there strong industrial demand but little academic research?
- Have hardware advances made old approaches suddenly viable?
- Is there a "right time" opportunity for a specific approach?

### 7. building_blocks（可组合方法原语）
Abstract the papers into COMPOSABLE METHOD PRIMITIVES:
- representations: What representations are used? (e.g., frequency domain, physical priors)
- architectures: What architectures are dominant? (e.g., Transformer, Mamba, GNN)
- optimization: What training techniques? (e.g., contrastive learning, physics-constrained loss)
- mechanisms: What mechanisms? (e.g., attention, memory, sparse computation)
These primitives can be recombined to create novel approaches.

2. Perform genuine cross-paper reasoning, not just summarization.
3. Gaps must be IMPLICIT (derived from comparing papers), not just explicit future work.
4. Limitations must be SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE, not generic.
5. Contradictions must be REAL conflicts, not just different approaches.
6. Opportunities must have TIMING rationale, not just "this is important".
7. Building blocks must be ABSTRACT and COMPOSABLE, not paper-specific.
8. Evidence papers must include relevance_to_topic justification.

CRITICAL: You MUST output ONLY the raw JSON object. DO NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks.
DO NOT include ```json or ``` markers.
DO NOT add any text before or after the JSON.
The output must be a valid JSON object starting with {{ and ending with }}.
```
