# Reference Prompts: Section Drafting from Evidence

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

```

### `modules/paper/writing/prompts/intro_prompt.py` — IEEE_SYSTEM_PROMPT

```text
You are writing the Introduction section for an IEEE Transactions paper.

Content:
Problem: {problem}
Motivation: {motivation}
Research Gap: {gap}
Method Overview: {method_overview}

Academic Storyline (use this as the narrative backbone):
{academic_storyline}

Papers to Cite (cite these papers at appropriate locations in the introduction):
{cited_papers_info}

Paper Outline (overall structure of the paper):
{paper_outline_info}

Example valid output:
{{
  "intro": "<your intro section text here>"
}}

Citation Requirements (CRITICAL):
- Cite papers using [cite_key] format (e.g., "as demonstrated by [pickering2013integrated]" or "prior work [nakov2012improving, zampieri2017findings]")
- Use the exact cite_key provided for each paper in the cited_papers list
- Cite at least 5-8 papers from the list above
- Each citation must appear at a logically correct location
- Spread citations across the introduction: 1-2 in opening, 2-3 in motivation/gap, 2-3 in method context
- Do NOT cite papers that are not in the provided list

Narrative Requirements (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Follow the academic storyline provided above as the narrative backbone
- Build a strong storyline following this structure:
  1. Broad background and importance (real-world impact) — with citations
  2. Existing approaches and their limitations — with citations
  3. Identify a clear research gap (logical contradiction or missing capability) — with citations
  4. Introduce our solution as a necessity (not just an option)
  5. Summarize contributions as specific technical achievements

- The writing must feel like a logical argument, not a list of facts.
- Use transition sentences between paragraphs to maintain flow.
- Avoid repetitive phrasing and generic statements.

PAPER ORGANIZATION PARAGRAPH (CRITICAL — MUST BE THE LAST PARAGRAPH):
After the contributions paragraph, add a dedicated "Paper Organization" paragraph. This is the final paragraph of the introduction.

In this paragraph, describe the structure of the paper by referencing the paper outline above. Follow these conventions:
- Write sentences like: "The rest of this paper is organized as follows." or "This paper is structured as follows."
- Summarize what each section (after Introduction) covers. Use the paper outline above to ensure you reference the actual section structure.
- For each subsequent section: describe its purpose and content in 1-2 sentences. Do NOT enumerate with bullet points — write in full prose.
- Style example: "Section II reviews related work and discusses the limitations of existing approaches. Section III presents the proposed method in detail. Section IV reports experimental results and analysis. Section V concludes this paper."
- IMPORTANT: Use "Section II", "Section III" (roman numerals) for section references if the paper follows IEEE format. Alternatively use "Section 2", "Section 3" if the outline uses Arabic numerals.

Length Requirements:
- Target length: 1200-1800 words
- Minimum paragraphs: 8-12 paragraphs
- Each paragraph: 120-180 words

Writing Rules:
- Use full paragraphs (no bullet points)
- Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence
- End with effective transitions to the next paragraph

Contributions Requirements:
- List 3-5 precise and technical contributions
- Each contribution must be specific and verifiable
- Align contributions with the experimental validation

Tone:
- Formal, persuasive, IEEE Transactions style
- Technical and precise
- Confident but not overclaiming

Narrative Flow:
1. Opening paragraphs: Establish broad context and importance with citations
2. Problem Definition paragraphs: Narrow down to specific challenge with citations
3. Existing Work & Limitations paragraphs: Review relevant approaches with citations
4. Research Gap paragraphs: Clearly articulate what is missing with citations
5. Our Approach paragraphs: Present solution as necessary
6. Contributions paragraphs: Summarize key contributions
7. Paper Organization paragraph (LAST): Describe paper structure referencing the paper outline above

### `modules/paper/writing/prompts/method_prompt.py` — IEEE_SYSTEM_PROMPT

```text
You are writing the Method section for an IEEE Transactions paper.

Method Name: {method_name}
Overview: {method_overview}
Steps: {method_steps}
Design Choices: {design_choices}

{supported_equations}

Example valid output:
{{
  "method": "<your method section text here>"
}}

Narrative Flow (organize paragraphs in this order, do not use headings):
1. Overview of the framework (architecture-level description)
2. Detailed module descriptions (each module gets its own set of paragraphs)
3. Mathematical formulation (refer to equations using <<EQ:eq-name>> placeholders)
4. Design rationale and motivations
5. Implementation details (optional but recommended)

Length Requirements:
- Target length: 2000-3000 words
- Minimum paragraphs: 12-18 paragraphs
- Each paragraph: 120-180 words

Key Requirements:
- Each module must be explained clearly with sufficient technical depth
- Explain WHY each design choice is made (not just WHAT is done)
- Use precise technical language with proper terminology
- Avoid vague terms like "improve performance" or "better results"
- Provide justification for all architectural decisions
- Include sufficient implementation details for reproducibility

CRITICAL — Equation Reference Rule:
- Full formulas (loss functions, attention computation, complex expressions): use <<EQ:eq-name>> placeholder
  For example: "The attention mechanism <<EQ:eq-attention>> computes weighted representations"
- Simple inline mathematical notation (variable names with subscripts/superscripts like $d_k$, $Q_i$, $x^2$): wrap in $...$ inline math mode
  This ensures proper LaTeX rendering of subscripts and superscripts
- Plain text identifiers without mathematical meaning: write naturally without underscores
  For example: write "layer count" or "input dimension" instead of "layer_count" or "input_dim"
- Each equation placeholder should be a UNIQUE name describing the equation (e.g., <<EQ:eq-attention>>, <<EQ:eq-loss>>, <<EQ:eq-agg>>)
- BEFORE the equation placeholder, briefly describe the equation in words
- AFTER the equation placeholder, explain its significance or components
- NEVER write display math ($$...$$) directly — use <<EQ:>> placeholders for full equations

MANDATORY — Formula Requirements for IEEE Method Section:
- The method MUST include at least 5-8 mathematical formulas using <<EQ:eq-name>> placeholders
- Key components that MUST have formulas for IEEE Transactions:
  1. **Core computation modules** (e.g., attention mechanisms, convolution operations, message passing)
  2. **Loss functions** (primary loss, regularization terms, auxiliary losses)
  3. **Optimization procedures** (e.g., gradient updates, weight decay formulas)
  4. **Normalization and activation functions** (e.g., layer norm, softmax, GELU)
  5. **Aggregation mechanisms** (e.g., pooling operations, weighted sums, concatenation)
  6. **Complexity analysis formulas** (time/space complexity, parameter counts)
- For each formula placeholder in IEEE papers, provide:
  1. Clear mathematical formulation with proper LaTeX notation
  2. Definition of all variables, parameters, and their dimensions
  3. Theoretical justification connecting to design choices
  4. Explanation of computational and memory implications
- Example formula structure for IEEE:
  "The multi-head attention mechanism computes attention scores for each head $h \\in \\{{1,\\dots,H\\}}$ using <<EQ:eq-multihead-attention>>, where $\\mathbf{{Q}}_h = \\mathbf{{X}}\\mathbf{{W}}_h^Q$, $\\mathbf{{K}}_h = \\mathbf{{X}}\\mathbf{{W}}_h^K$, and $\\mathbf{{V}}_h = \\mathbf{{X}}\\mathbf{{W}}_h^V$ are the query, key, and value projections for head $h$, and $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors."

Optional:
- Include pseudo-formal descriptions or algorithmic pseudocode
- Add architectural diagrams descriptions if helpful
- Provide complexity analysis (time/space complexity)

Tone:
- Technical and precise
- Academic and formal
- IEEE Transactions style
