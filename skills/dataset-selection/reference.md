# Reference Prompts: Dataset Selection & Data Pipeline Specification

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

### `modules/experiment/dataset/prompts/dataset_planning_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are a dataset collection expert for scientific experiments.

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Planning Data:
{planning_data}

Your Task:
Plan the datasets needed for the experiment.

Return a JSON with the following structure.
The top-level JSON must contain exactly ONE key: "dataset_planning" (all content goes inside it):
{{
  "dataset_planning": {{
  "datasets": [
    {{
      "dataset_id": "unique_id_1",
      "name": "Dataset Name",
      "source": "HuggingFace / Kaggle / Custom / etc.",

    }}
  ],
  "overall_strategy": "Brief description of data collection strategy",
  "preprocessing_pipeline": "Step-by-step preprocessing workflow"
  }}
}}

Rules:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown
2. Focus on standard public datasets (HuggingFace preferred)
3. Include preprocessing requirements specific to the experiment
4. Ensure datasets are appropriate for the research topic

```text
You are a data pipeline architect for scientific experiments.

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Dataset Plan:
{dataset_planning}

Your Task:
Define structured requirements for the data pipeline code. Do NOT write the actual code.

Directory Structure for generated code:
  github-repo/datasets/     ← Data pipeline code and downloaded datasets go HERE
  github-repo/src/          ← Research method code (separate)
  github-repo/results/      ← Experiment results (separate)

Return a JSON with the following structure.
The top-level JSON must contain exactly ONE key: "dataset_code_requirements" (all content goes inside it):
{{
  "dataset_code_requirements": {{
  "objective": "Overall objective of the data pipeline code",
  "pipeline_steps": [
    {{
      "step": "Step name (e.g. download, load, preprocess, split)",
      "description": "What this step should do",
      "libraries": ["required Python libraries for this step"],
      "expected_output": "What this step produces"
    }}
  ],

      "features": ["list of features/columns"]
    }}
  ],
  "target_directory": "github-repo/datasets/"
  }}
}}

Rules:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown
2. Specify requirements, NOT the actual code
3. If datasets cannot be downloaded (no internet), specify generating simulated dataset statistics
4. Focus on what the code should achieve, not how
5. Generated code files MUST be placed under the target_directory

### `modules/experiment/method/prompts/data_collection_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert data engineer working with a Code Agent, an AI-assisted coding tool. Your role is to generate Python code for downloading and preprocessing datasets for a deep learning experiment.

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Planning Data (selected plan):
{planning_data}

========================
# Your Task as Code Agent Data Collector
========================

Generate Python code for data collection and preprocessing. The code should:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Use HuggingFace `datasets` library to load the specified dataset(s)
2. **Data Exploration**: Print dataset statistics (size, features, class distribution)
3. **Preprocessing**: Apply necessary preprocessing steps (tokenization, normalization, encoding)
4. **Train/Validation/Test Split**: Split the data appropriately
5. **DataLoader Creation**: Create PyTorch DataLoader or TensorFlow Dataset objects
6. **Data Statistics**: Compute and display key statistics about the processed data

IMPORTANT: Use only well-known libraries: `datasets`, `torch`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`.

========================
# Output Format
========================

### `modules/experiment/prompts/baseline_builder_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert baseline result generator for scientific experiments. Your task has TWO parts:

**Part 1**: Generate simulated baseline results based on core papers from the literature review
**Part 2**: Create test cases that will guide code implementation and verify results against baselines

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Core Papers (from Discovery module):
{core_papers}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

========================
# Part 1: Generate Baseline Results
========================

{full_text_context}

Baseline Methods to simulate:
{baseline_methods}

Evaluation Metrics:
{primary_metric} (primary) + {evaluation_metrics}

For each baseline method, generate results that:
1. Are realistic and consistent with the paper descriptions
2. Follow the expected format of experiment results
3. Include the primary metric and all secondary metrics

========================
# Part 2: Generate Dataset Information
========================

Based on the research topic and core papers, identify key datasets used in this research area.
For each dataset, provide:
1. Dataset name and description
2. Key characteristics (size, domain, language, etc.)
3. Relevant paper references (if available in core papers)
4. How each baseline method typically uses this dataset

Common datasets in this field: {common_datasets}

========================
# Part 3: Create Test Cases
========================

Create Python test cases that verify the implementation can achieve results comparable to these baselines.
These test cases will be used by the coding environment to guide code development.

Each test case should specify:
1. What to test (functionality, metric achievement)
2. Input data format (referencing the datasets above)
3. Expected output threshold compared to baseline
4. How to validate the result

========================
# Output Format
========================

Format your response as a SINGLE JSON object with the following structure:
