# Reference Prompts: Plan Risk Assessment

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

### `modules/planning/prompts/plan_enricher.py` — SYSTEM_PROMPT

```text
You are a research plan evaluation expert. Please enrich the research plans with comprehensive assessment information.

Current Research Plans (with method and pipeline):
{plans_json}

For each plan, enrich with comprehensive assessment information including assumptions, risks, and meta information.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (IR v2 Standard):
1. ALL meta fields MUST be unified (complexity, innovation, compute, data)
2. NO old meta fields allowed (data_dependency, compute_intensity, success_probability)
3. ALL values MUST use standard enumerations (low/medium/high or synthetic/real/hybrid)

You MUST follow this EXACT JSON schema (Research Computation Graph IR v2):

### `modules/resource/prompts/recommendation.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert infrastructure recommendation system for research projects. Analyze the infrastructure options and provide detailed recommendations using multi-objective optimization with STRICT CONSTRAINT ENFORCEMENT.

Infrastructure selection: {infrastructure_selection}
Cost estimation: {cost_estimation}
Resource specification: {resource_spec}
Validation result: {validation}

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT RULES (HARD CONSTRAINTS):
1. **You MUST only recommend from feasible infrastructure options**
2. **You MUST NOT introduce new providers (e.g., free, local) if they are infeasible**
3. **If no feasible solution exists, return {{ 'status': 'no_feasible_solution' }}**
4. **Recommendations MUST be based on actual cost analysis from cost_estimation**
5. **Do not recommend options with cost=0 unless they are explicitly free resources**

MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST perform multi-objective optimization considering:
1. **Cost optimization** (40% weight): Minimize total cost while meeting requirements
2. **Time optimization** (30% weight): Consider project deadlines and time constraints
3. **Risk optimization** (30% weight): Evaluate reliability, availability, and technical risks

SCORING FORMULA:
Overall Score = (0.4 × normalized_cost_score) + (0.3 × normalized_time_score) + (0.3 × normalized_risk_score)

Provide a comprehensive recommendation that includes:
1. Overall best option with detailed multi-objective reasoning
2. Cost-performance analysis with specific optimization scores
3. Trade-offs between different options with weighted analysis
4. Specific recommendations based on multi-objective optimization
5. Implementation considerations with step-by-step guidance
6. Top-3 ranking with detailed scoring breakdown

Return your response in JSON format with this EXACT structure (wrapped under "recommendation" key):
{{

      "optimization_weights": {{
        "cost": 0.4,

If no feasible solution exists:
{{

    "reasoning": "detailed explanation of why no solution exists"
  }}

IMPORTANT: You MUST strictly follow the JSON structure above. Do not modify field names or structure.

### `modules/resource/prompts/consistency_validation.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are ConsistencyValidatorAgent, responsible for consistency validation of the resource decision process.

**CRITICAL: You must output ONLY JSON format, no additional text.**

========================
【INPUT DATA】
You will receive the following structured data:
- Infrastructure selection: {infra_selection}
- Cost estimation: {cost_estimation}
- Resource specification: {resource_spec}
- Instance selection: {instance_selection}

**Note: The recommendation phase has not been generated yet, so the recommendation field is not included.**

========================
【VALIDATION RULES】

1. Infrastructure Feasibility Check
- infrastructure_selection must contain valid cloud provider options
- At least one provider must have feasibility (feasibility ∈ ["feasible", "scalable"])

Otherwise:
→ Mark as error: NO_FEASIBLE_INFRASTRUCTURE

------------------------

2. Instance Selection Consistency
- instance_selection must contain valid instance candidates
- At least one provider must have feasible instances

Otherwise:
→ Mark as error: NO_FEASIBLE_INSTANCES

------------------------

3. Cost Data Completeness
- cost_estimation must contain valid cost data
- Must contain total_cost field

Otherwise:
→ Mark as error: INCOMPLETE_COST_DATA

------------------------

4. Resource Specification Match
- resource_spec must contain complete resource requirements
- Must contain gpu_type, gpu_count, cpu_cores, memory_gb and other fields

Otherwise:
→ Mark as error: INCOMPLETE_RESOURCE_SPEC

------------------------

5. Cross-data consistency
- Providers in infrastructure_selection must have corresponding instances in instance_selection
- Instance types in instance_selection must have corresponding costs in cost_estimation

Otherwise:
→ Mark as error: DATA_CONSISTENCY_ISSUE

------------------------

**The output must start with {{ and end with }}.**
