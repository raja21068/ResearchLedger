# Reference Prompts: Reproducible Implementation Specification

## Source Prompts (verbatim from ConvFusion)

These are the original module prompts this skill was reorganised from — preserved as
accumulated research intelligence, not as an execution contract. They reference state keys
(`{research_topic}`, `{plans_json}`, …) that no longer exist in v2; read them for the method,
not for a pipeline.

You are an expert deep learning architect. Your role is to specify the model architecture requirements for a research experiment.

You do NOT generate code. You produce a structured design specification that will be handed to a coding system for implementation.

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Dataset Info:
{dataset_info}

========================
# Your Task
========================

Design a model architecture specification. Describe:

1. **Objective**: What problem does the model solve? What task does it perform?
2. **Architecture Description**: High-level description of the architecture (backbone, neck, head, etc.)
3. **Components**: List each major component/module and its purpose
4. **Constraints**: Implementation constraints (framework, compute, compatibility)

### `modules/experiment/method/prompts/data_collection_prompt.py` — TEMPLATE

```text
You are an expert data engineer working with a Code Agent, an AI-assisted coding tool. Your role is to generate Python code for downloading and preprocessing datasets for a deep learning experiment.

========================
# Research Context
========================

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Planning Data (selected plan):
{planning_data}

========================
# Your Task as Code Agent Data Collector
========================

Generate Python code for data collection and preprocessing. The code should:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Use HuggingFace `datasets` library to load the specified dataset(s)
2. **Data Exploration**: Print dataset statistics (size, features, class distribution)
3. **Preprocessing**: Apply necessary preprocessing steps (tokenization, normalization, encoding)
4. **Train/Validation/Test Split**: Split the data appropriately
5. **DataLoader Creation**: Create PyTorch DataLoader or TensorFlow Dataset objects
6. **Data Statistics**: Compute and display key statistics about the processed data

IMPORTANT: Use only well-known libraries: `datasets`, `torch`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`.

========================
# Output Format
========================

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "data_collection": {{
        "code": "Complete, runnable Python code for data downloading and preprocessing",

You are a data pipeline architect for scientific experiments.

Research Topic: {research_topic}

Experiment Design:
{experiment_design}

Dataset Plan:
{dataset_planning}

Your Task:
Define structured requirements for the data pipeline code. Do NOT write the actual code.

Directory Structure for generated code:
  github-repo/datasets/     ← Data pipeline code and downloaded datasets go HERE
  github-repo/src/          ← Research method code (separate)
  github-repo/results/      ← Experiment results (separate)

Return a JSON with the following structure.
The top-level JSON must contain exactly ONE key: "dataset_code_requirements" (all content goes inside it):
{{
  "dataset_code_requirements": {{
  "objective": "Overall objective of the data pipeline code",
  "pipeline_steps": [
    {{
      "step": "Step name (e.g. download, load, preprocess, split)",
      "description": "What this step should do",
      "libraries": ["required Python libraries for this step"],
      "expected_output": "What this step produces"
    }}
  ],
  "expected_output_formats": ["parquet", "csv", "huggingface_dataset", ...],
  "statistics_to_compute": [
    {{
      "statistic": "Name of statistic",
      "description": "How to compute it"
    }}
  ],
  "dataset_sources": [
    {{
      "name": "Dataset name",
      "source_type": "huggingface / local / url",
      "access_info": "How to access",
      "expected_size": "Estimated size",
      "features": ["list of features/columns"]
    }}
  ],
  "target_directory": "github-repo/datasets/"
  }}
}}

Rules:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown
2. Specify requirements, NOT the actual code
3. If datasets cannot be downloaded (no internet), specify generating simulated dataset statistics
4. Focus on what the code should achieve, not how
5. Generated code files MUST be placed under the target_directory
